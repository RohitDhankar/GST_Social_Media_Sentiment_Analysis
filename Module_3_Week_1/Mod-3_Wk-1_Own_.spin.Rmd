# So, we first need to create a combination (abbreviated as “combin” below) for our imaginary lock.
# In order to do this, we select the number of choices (abbreviated as “choi” below) for each of the three
# integers of our combination (with replacement). Then, we sample 3 integers with replacement from a
# sequence of values from 1 to 50 (choices) to create our combination.
### Tutorial Comments - Original refrence / Tutorial comments follow - ### in place of my own comments wich follow # 

choi <- 50; choi
### Created a Numeric Vector CHOI - Choice and assigned 50 value 
combin <- sample(seq(1:choi), 3, replace = T); combin
str(combin)

# lockpick.fun does nothing to begin with as no Arguments are specified 
# it needs two arguments - "combination" and "choices" 

lockpick.fun <- function(combination, choices){
  ch <- seq(1:choices)
  solution.matrix <- expand.grid(ch, ch, ch)
  i <- 0
  picked <- "FALSE"
  while(picked == "FALSE"){
    i <- i + 1
    draw <- solution.matrix[i,]
    if(combination[1] == draw[1] & combination[2] == draw[2] &
         combination[3] == draw[3]){
      picked <- "TRUE"; print("PICKED!!")}
  }
  out <- paste("Number of iterations =", i, sep = " ")
  return(out)
}

# 
combin <- sample(seq(1:choi), 3, replace = T); combin
system.time(test.1 <- lockpick.fun(combination = combin, choices = choi))
# As compared to the Tute - PDF file -- _____MAIN___Parallel_L_JDS_Mar2014
# their comp did the calc in - 31.24 seconds
# my comp did the calc in - 98.89  seconds
test.1

# b.results <- as.list(0)
# str(b.results)
# # creates a List of 1 - a blank list $: num 0 
# b.results
# # we get same number of iterations as earlier -- Number of iterations = 95732

#

# Next, we can run 3 iterations of our lock pick function using the ‘foreach’ 
# function of the ‘foreach’ package (Weston, 2013). The ‘foreach’ function below 
# looks remarkably like the for loop from above. 
# First, the number of iterations (i) are specified (1:3), 
# then the ‘dopar’ (do parallel) operator is used to specify
# what is supposed to be iterated.

# here b.time rewritten according to the function b.time on page 5 of PDF 

b.results <- as.list(0)
b.time <- system.time(for (i in 1:3){
  b.results[[i]] <- lockpick.fun(combination = combin, choices = choi)
})[3]

str(b.results)
b.results

str(b.time)
b.time

### Tutorial Comment ---- So, the above output indicates it took our single core 
# (default R installation) 253 seconds to complete 3
# iterations of our lock picking function. The “b.time” is simply an 
# object containing the baseline amount
# of time required.

# Own comment - 1 core - 3 iterations - Number of iterations = 7041
# Own -b.time == elapsed 20.01
# Now we try Multicore - in our case 2 core processing 
library(doParallel)
registerDoParallel(cores = 2)
getDoParWorkers()
# as seen we have now two cores - we have registered 2 cores even without creating a 
# cluster of 2 cores as was done earlier with -- cl <- makeCluster(2) , above .

# t.time <- system.time(t.results <- foreach(i = 1:3) %dopar%
#                         b.time <- system.time(for (i in 1:3){
#                           lockpick.fun(combination = combin, choices = choi))[3]
#                       
#                       
# 
# 
# t.time <- system.time(t.results <- foreach(i = 1:3)) %dopar%
# b.time_1 <- system.time(for (i in 1:3) {
#   b.results_1[[i]] <- lockpick.fun(combination = combin, choices = choi))[3]
# t.results
